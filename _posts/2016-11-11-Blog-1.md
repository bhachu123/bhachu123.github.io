    <td>The thing that limited my working was not being able to see the board when the teacher was explaining something. This was because there was someone obstructing me from seeing the board and looking at where i was meant to be going. Habits that I need to work on is taking notes when the teacher is giving me instructions.</td>

    <td>Things that I can change for next time is being able to see the board and not being obstructed by other students who are standing. The way that I could improve my learning is by taking more notes in detail and not brief ones so when i don't understand what I have written I will not have to ask people around me for help on the step that I am stuck on</td>
